  * Fix SEX bug.  Pretty much everything runs correctly now (including
    Racer Ball, Rommel 3D, Android Attack).
  * Stopped using GP32 SDK sound code, adapted some of Jouni 'Mr.Spiv'
    Korhonen's code.
  * Refactored code to something a little more logical.
  * MacOS X 'Carbon' UI contributed by Stuart Teasdale.
  * Use C99 types instead of SDL ones except in SDL-based drivers.
  * Wrote faster GP32-specific VDG routines.

  * Video rendering optimisations.
  * s/LICENCE/COPYING/
  * Basic GP32 menu system added.
  * Ability to switch between Dragon and CoCo ROMs and keymaps.

Version 0.8, Mon  3 May 2004

  * Added GTK interface option (default) to Unix build.
  * Timing fixes - most things play at a better speed now.

Version 0.7, Wed  7 Apr 2004

  * Added basic Unix joystick support (using SDL).
  * PIA0 addressing more specific (D64-style), OS-9 boots!
  * PIA implementation simplified.
  * Debug level configurable at build time (defaults to "not too much").
  * Keyboard handling changed; GP32 version will be easier to switch to
    CoCo mode when the time comes.
